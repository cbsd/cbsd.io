# Jail import

**jimport command**

**Description:**

Import jail from (*.img) file.

In jname argument you can set full path to file or just filename (without .img extension) if file placed in `$workdir/import` directory. img-file after import is not modified. In addition, you can import an image of a jail in an alternate name (for example, you want to deploy the image of the jail1 from jail1.img, however, your system already has a jail of the same name). In this case, an argument newjname can be used.

**Example:**

import jail from `/tmp/mysqljail.img` file:

```
% cbsd jimport jname=/tmp/mysqljail.img
```

**Example:**

import the image jail2.img placed in `$workdir/import` with a new name **jail5**:

```
% cbsd jimport jname=jail2 newjname=jail5
```
