# FreeBSD: XEN DOM0

**Introduction**

Starting from **CBSD** 10.3.0 experimental support of [XEN](http://xenproject.org/) hypervisor has been added

Since CBSD provides only a script wrapper to work with XEN, for their work you need to hold the system configuration in accordance with the documentation [XEN FreeBSD Dom0](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/FreeBSD_Dom0)

To create and operate with XEN through the CBSD, use the prefix x for the corresponding commands: xconstruct-tui, xls, xstop, xstart, xremove
