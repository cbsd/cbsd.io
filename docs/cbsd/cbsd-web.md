# CBSD WEB interface

## WEB interface

### Web based interface



**CBSD** offers a web based interface called **ClonOS**. **ClonOS** is developed independently to be a standalone platform to manage and create virtual environments in **FreeBSD**. **ClonOS** itself is also **FreeBSD** based, and can be installed and run as a purpose built **FreeBSD** distribution.

More information can be found on the **ClonOS** website: [clonos.tekroutine.com](https://clonos.tekroutine.com/)

Once enough positive feedback about **ClonOS** is received, and the developers feel it stable enough, it will be available via the **FreeBSD** ports tree.

While **ClonOS** is not currently considered to be production ready, the following features are functionally stable;

  * Interface to create and manage jails
  * Interface for manage bhyve
  * Interface to CBSD forms (Helpers to assist with common tasks)
  * Interface to work with/configure FreeBSD sources and bases

The developers are very interested in feedback by those using **ClonOS**. The more testing, and feedback provided, the quicker **ClonOS** will make it into the ports tree. Please click [here](https://www.bsdstore.ru/en/feedback.html) for more information on submitting feedback.
